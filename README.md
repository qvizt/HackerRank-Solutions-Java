# HackerRank Solutions in Java
This repository contains my current solutions for
the challenges of [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).

Be aware that i try to stick as closely as possible to the
code provided by the authors of the challenges. That means the code is 
often not conform to the code conventions.

## Overview
What has been solved so far:

|Domain|Status|
|---|---|
|[30 Days of Code](30%20Days%20of%20Code)|Day 08 done|
|[Java](Java)|52 of 64 solved|

## Miscellaneous
Solutions are written using Java 8 and Eclipse Oxygen.

The usage of  Eclipse helps to format the code in a more
readable manner and the code completion via the content assist
is way better than the editor of the website.
