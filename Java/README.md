# HackerRank Solutions in Java
This directory and its subfolders contain code written in Java to solve the challenges of [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).

Be aware that i try to stick as closely as possible to the code provided by the authors of the challenges. That means the code is  often not conform to the code conventions.

## Overview
What has been done so far.

|Domain|Status|

|[30 Days of Code (Tutorials)](30%20Days%20of%20Code)|Day 09 done|
|[Java (Language Proficiency)](Java)|Complete|

## Miscellaneous
Solutions are written using Java 8 and Eclipse Oxygen.

The usage of  Eclipse helps to format the code in a more readable manner and the code completion via content assist
is way better than the one provided by HackerRank.
