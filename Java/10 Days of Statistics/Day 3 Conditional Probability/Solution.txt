Solution for Day 3: Conditional Probability
=============================
No Java, just simple usage of the human brain.

Abbreviations:
b = boy
g = girl

1) Collect all possible outcomes

Two choices and two genders leading to:
{ bb, bg, gb, gg }

2) Elimination of impossible outcome

The family already has a boy, so the
outcome gg is not possible. 

This leads to the possible outcomes:
{ bb, bg, gb }

3) Result

One of three possible outcomes is bb,
so the probability is 1 / 3
