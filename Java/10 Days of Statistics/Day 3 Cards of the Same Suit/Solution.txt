Solution for Day 3: Cards of the Same Suit
=============================
No Java, just simple usage of the human brain.

52 card deck and 4 suits leading to 13 cards per suite.

1) First card

After drawing the first card the number of cards is
reduced to 51. The related suite (to the drawn card)
has 12 cards left.

2) Second card

Based on the observation in 1) we get the result:

12 cards that have the same suite like the first card
divided by
51 cards left

= 12/51 = 4/17
