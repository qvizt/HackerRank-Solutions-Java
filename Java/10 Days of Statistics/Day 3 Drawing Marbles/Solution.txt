Solution for Day 3: Drawing Marbles
=============================
No Java, just simple usage of the human brain.

Abbreviations:
r = red
b = blue

1) First draw (already done in description of the task)

3r + 4b = 7 marbles

One red marble is picked, so 6 marbles are left: 
2r + 4b = 6 

2) Second draw

4 of the 6 marbles left are blue. So the result is
4/6 = 2/3
